          <p>
            Hello, my name is Patricia, but my friends call me Paty; I am 30
            years old and graduated recently in system analysis. I worked for
            two years as a software developer, but I have always been interested
            in the design field. I was searching for a design course, and I
            found Interactive Media design, where I could improve my skills as a
            software developer and learn about design. I am a dog person, and I
            enjoy going to the beach with my friends and cooking gluten-free
            foods.
          </p>
